# COVID-19 Dashboard

COVID-19 Dashboard is a personal project that is designed to visualize COVID-19 data of locations throughout the world at a glance.

The data source comes from the public JHU CSSE Github repository and is processed to produce numbers, such as new cases, new deaths, and produces a graph on these numbers for easy visualization.  
  
If you are interested, the web application can be viewed at https://covid-case-dashboard.herokuapp.com/.  
As Heroku uses an ephemeral filesystem, the data will be reset periodically and has to be manually updated via the button in the web application.
